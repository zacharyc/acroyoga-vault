There are a bunch of videos talking about Big Le Moi out there, but there are very few written documents talking about it.

Simply it can be written as:
FP -> RIS -> GMITh -> GMIth -> RIS (repeat)

FP = Front Plank
RIS = Reverse Inside Star
GMITh = Goofy Mono Icarian Throne

## Break Down
### From The Bases' Point of View
Starting in front plank, go to reverse inside star. Rotate the flyer to move their head away form you so you can make contact with the lower foot in the side star.

Bring your free foot around the flyers arm on your leg and bring the foot to the thutt area with your foot oriented so your angle rotated such that heal will be on the side of the flyer when they are sitting. Allow the flyer to role onto your foot and reach for the high foot with the other hand.

Once you are in Goofy Mono Icarian Throne, you are going to bring your free leg in front of your connected leg and contact the other thutt in a mirror position. Transfer the weight and move the second side.

This is the most challenging move for the base. Place your free foot such that it is parallel with your basing foot, lower on the leg such that the big toe of the free foot is around the heal of the connected foot. This position may vary based on height and leg lengths, but that is a good place to start.

Start to rotate your flyers feet towards the turning direction. As the flyer begins to lean over the new foot, let go of their far foot. Holding a loose grip on the the connected ankle move the foot around the approprate place for a reverse inside star. Piston the legs to transfer weight from thutt to side star leg. Bend the side star leg as needed to get balance in reverse side star.

Transition through front plank/bird or directly to the other reverse inside star to continue the washing machine.

### From The flyer's perspective
Starting in front plank, turn to reverse inside star. Focus on keeping your body in a straight plane and keeping your body open so the base connect to the foot. Keep legs strong as the base rotates you to a goof mono icarain throne. Only bend at the hips once the weight shifts to the thutt.

Keep the butt squeezed through the movement from one side to the other. Remember to keep legs strong (pro tip: focus on pointing the toes).

This is the most challenging move for the flyer. As the rotation from the Goofy Mono Icarian Throne to reverse inside star. Start by leaning back and over the side you are moving to. It is important to think about going over and back and not immediately bending at the hip. Reach arm down and find the correct resting spot on the bases leg to hold the reverse inside star. **While this is only one simple paragraph, this is really hard**.

Transition through front plank/bird or directly to the other reverse inside star to continue the washing machine.

### Notes:
- Much of this washing machine is about the flyer hitting a body positions and being predictable. This is challenging for both roles.
