## Front Plank

This is the first step into the world of birds. It's a supported version of regular bird.

In this pose the flyer is roughly parallel with the ground and the base is lying on the ground in a L shape. The flyers hands and the bases hands are connected and aimed through the bases shoulders.

[[Hand Grips]]

Foundation
Base: Lies on the ground, hips can be elevated if needed by placing a yoga mat or a bolster under the bases sacrum. Base initially places feet on hip bones of the flyer standing at their feet.

Flyer: Flyer stands behind the base about six inches behind the bases hips. You can use the [[arm distance measurement]] if you would like. If the flyer is familiar with where they prefer the feet placement, they can adjust the bases feet position around their hips.

Action:
Flyer: bending only at the ankles the flyer hinges forward while maintaining a plank position. Arms can drift forward, with mitten hands fingers facing forwards. Flyer should maintain straight arms throughout the pose.

Base: Bend the knees into the arm pits to receive the flyers weight. Once the base feels the flyers weight, they can slowly extend through their heels to bring the flyer to parallel. The bases receives the flyers palms with mitten hands with fingers facing out. The base can bend their arms to receive the flyers arms, but press through the flyers shoulders to reach th final position of the pose. 

Dismount:
The base lowers the knees to the shoulders while keeping the arms straight. Once the flyer makes contact with the ground the base extends the flyer by pushing through the toes to get the flyer to perpendicular with the ground.

Pro Tips:
- When you first start, knowing where your legs are perpendicular is hard. Having a spot tell you when you are perpendicular to the ground can be VERY helpful.
- Foot placement can be hard and everyone is different. Try different placements until you find what is comfortable.
- Once you have the basics of pose you can try rotating the flyer and then pressing the flyer up and down as ways to strengthen yourself in those poses.
