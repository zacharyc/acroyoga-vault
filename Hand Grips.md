## Bird Grip
This is a grip for doing bird.

**Flyers Fingers Forwards** is the alliteration you need to remember for this grip.

Both the flyer and base have mitten hands where the fingers are all together and the thumb is out to the side (perpendicular). The alliteration above is super helpful. The flyers fingers face fowards and so the bases fingers need to face to the outside to fit in.

## Hand to Hand Grip
This grip is used for doing hand to hand and other poses like star. For some reason it's known as hand to hand grip. It is also sometimes known as peace grip.

In this grip, both partners shoot two fingers down the wrist. Thumbs lock and the other two fingers wrap the hand. The goal is to compress the space between the palms.

## Bro Grip / Butterfly Grip

This is a grip where each person extends the same sided hand. Interlock the thumbs and wrap the rest of the fingers around the backside of the palm. 

This grip is used mostly for a thing called courtesy. Helping people up and down to the ground.
